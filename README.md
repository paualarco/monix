## Overview

Monix is a high-performance Scala / Scala.js library for composing asynchronous,
event-based programs.

It started as a proper implementation of [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/),
with stronger functional programming influences and designed from the ground up
for  back-pressure and made to cleanly interact with Scala's standard library,
compatible out-of-the-box with the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/)
protocol. It then expanded to include abstractions for suspending side effects
and for resource handling, being one of the parents and implementors of
[cats-effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/).

A [Typelevel project](http://typelevel.org/projects/), Monix proudly
exemplifies pure, typeful, functional programming in Scala, while making no
compromise on performance.

Highlights:

- exposes the kick-ass `Observable`, `Iterant`, `Task` and `Coeval` data types,
  along with all the support they need
- modular, only use what you need
- designed for true asynchronicity, running on both the
  JVM and [Scala.js](http://scala-js.org)
- really good test coverage, code quality and API documentation
  as a primary project policy

## Usage

See **[monix-sample](https://github.com/monix/monix-sample)** for
a project exemplifying Monix used both on the server and on the client.

### Dependencies

The packages are published on Maven Central.

For the stable release (compatible with Cats and Cats-Effect 2.x):

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.monix" %% "monix" % "3.2.2"
```

### Sub-projects

Monix 3.x is modular by design, so you can pick and choose:

- `monix-catnap` exposes pure abstractions built on top of
   the [Cats-Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) type classes;
   depends on `monix-execution`, Cats 1.x and Cats-Effect
- `monix-execution` exposes the low-level execution environment, or
  more precisely `Scheduler`, `Cancelable`, `Atomic`, `Local`, `CancelableFuture`
  and `Future` based abstractions from `monix-catnap`.
- `monix-eval` exposes `Task`, `Coeval`;
  depends on `monix-execution`
- `monix-reactive` exposes `Observable` for modeling reactive,
  push-based streams with back-pressure; depends on `monix-eval`
- `monix-tail` exposes `Iterant` streams for purely functional pull
  based streaming; depends on `monix-eval` and makes heavy use of
  Cats-Effect
- `monix` provides all of the above

### Versioning Scheme

The versioning scheme follows the
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) (semver) specification,
meaning that stable versions have the form `$major.$minor.$patch`,
such that:

1. `$major` version updates make binary incompatible API changes
2. `$minor` version updates adds functionality in a
   backwards-compatible manner, and
3. `$patch` version updates makes backwards-compatible bug fixes

For development snapshots may be published to Sonatype at any time.
Development versions have the form: `$major.$minor.$patch-$hash`
(example `3.0.0-d3288bb`).

The `$hash` is the 7 character git hash prefix of the commit from
which the snapshot was published.  Thus, "snapshots" can be used as
repeatable upstream dependencies if you're feeling courageous.  NO
GUARANTEE is made for upgrades of development versions, use these at
your own risk.
